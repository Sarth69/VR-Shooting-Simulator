# VR-Shooting-Simulator
My first VR personal project, which is a training room to learn how to shoot with guns or a bow in VR.

Video presenting the project : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-dy033t7CXzj78oqJXaygxGOiWMG8tay/view?usp=sharing
Disclaimer : the video looks shaky. That's because this game is meant to be played in a VR headset, so what you see is just a transcription on a 2D screen of part of what is seen in the headset. Try the experience in real situation to see the difference.
